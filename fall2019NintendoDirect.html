  <time> September 6, 2019 </time>
  <p>  Nintendo showed off many existing games, new services for their Nintendo Online service, and also showed off some surprise announcements in their Fall 2019 Direct. </p>
  <p>  They began the Direct with the leak that has been the talk of the last week, Overwatch on the Nintendo Switch. It will release on October 15th. </p>
  <p>  They featured new floor level designs within Luigi’s Mansion 3 including a dance themed floor, an Egyptian and Mummy themed floor, and many more. They also introduced an online component for the game called Scream Park. It is a mode that is aimed towards playing together with your friends via a 4v4 party mode. </p>
  <p>  They announced the next Kirby game, Super Kirby Clash. It features 100+ quests that all seem to embrace a boss rush mode. It is a free-to-start game that released the day of the Nintendo Direct. </p>
  <p>  Trials of Mana is being remade, which they announced prior to this Direct, however they showed off a new trailer and showed the release date, which is April 24th, 2020. </p>
  <p>  The independent phenomena of last year, Return of the Obra Dinn will be released in the Fall of this year. Return of the Obra Dinn is a fantastic gorgeous black and white hand drawn detailed game that I will be playing definitely when all the new Fall releases calm down this year. </p>
  <p>  Town, from GameFreak that was announced during the Fall 2018 Nintendo Direct, is now called Little Town Hero and the new trailer featured the unique style of the game, some characters, and the battle system. The trailer also announced when the game is being released, October 16th. </p>
  <p>  Super Smash Brothers Ultimate would be the next major talking point with the announcement that Banjo Kazooie was released the day of the Direct as the third DLC character. After the Direct, Masahiro Sakurai showcased the character in a presentation video that was directly followed after the Direct. They also announced the next DLC character as part of the first Character Pack, Terry Bogard from the Fatal Fury series by SNK. He will be released in November of 2019. They also revealed that the fifth DLC character of the first Character Pack will not be the last DLC character and they will be including more DLC fighters in the future. </p>
  <p>  Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE Encore will be released after being dormant on the WiiU. It will be released on January 17th, The original game came out in 2015 and was developed by Atlus, the creators of Persona and Shin Megami Tensei series. It is a combination of the gameplay, narrative, and aesthetic elements of Fire Emblem and Shin Megami Tensei. </p>
  <p>  The next major announcement was that Deadly Premonition 2: A Blessing in Disguise is being released in 2020. The first game was also released the day of the Direct. The original came out in 2010 on the last generation of consoles. The Deadly Premonition series is open-world survival horror. </p>
  <p>  Old school games were heavily featured in this Direct as well with Doom 64 being announced by Bethesda. It will be released on November 22nd. A major surprise came when Star Wars: Jedi Knight 2: Jedi Outcast was announced to be released on September 24th. Shortly after the Direct, they also announced that its sequel, Jedi Academy, would also be releasing on the Switch in Early 2020. The last major non-surprise came when the SNES Online Service was announced. The service will include 20 games with the major ones being Super Mario Kart, Super Metroid, Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Star Fox, F-Zero, Super Ghouls’n Ghosts, Super Mario World, and Super Mario World 2: Yoshi’s Island. The SNES Online Service will launch on September 5th, which is when you will most likely be reading this! </p>
  <p>  Their next focus came with Pokemon Sword and Shield showcasing three new features, and introducing two new Pokemon. The first new feature is that character customization is returning, but with new tweaks. You can finally change your hairstyle. You can put makeup on your woman character, and you can now add layers of clothing to your character, other than just having many shirts to choose from. The second feature they featured was Pokemon Camp, where you can camp with your Party Pokemon. You may visit other players camps and interact with their Pokemon. The last feature they showcased was that you can now cook! There will be over 100 recipes that you can create and feed to you and your Pokemon. This seems like it’ll be exclusive to the Pokemon Camp feature. The two Pokemon they showed off were Polteagist which is a teacup Ghost type Pokemon. The other is Cramorant who is a seagull Flying/Water type. However, if it uses Surf or Dive, it’s special ability can go into effect, Gulp Missile. If it is hurt after the attack from the fish it picked up while using Surf or Dive, Cramorant will use the fish in its mouth as a missile on the other Pokemon, having the opportunity to counter the hit it just took. </p>
  <p>  Animal Crossing: New Horizons had a new trailer and showed some new features. Tom Nook will give you a NookPhone which has many features, like creating items from materials you find throughout your adventure. New gameplay mechanics include being able to move trees and being able to play locally with four other players, while playing with eight others online. </p>
  <p>  The last announcement they had was that the Wii 2012 classic, Xenoblade Chronicles is being released in 2020, as Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition. The game has been remastered in high definition to make it clearly stand out from its predecessor. </p>
  <p>  Those were all the major announcements I took from the Fall 2019 Nintendo Direct! Thank you for taking time out of your day to read this! </p>
