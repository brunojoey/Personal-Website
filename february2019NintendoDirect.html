     <p> Nintendo held a Direct yesterday and it truly did not disappoint. </p>
     <p> The Direct opened up with Super Mario Maker 2 being announced for June 2019. It showcased new styles to implement in creating levels, and also showcased new powers to bring with your creative self. </p>
     <p> They brought a lot of details to discuss Fire Emblem Three Houses. It is pushed from its Spring release date to July 26th. However, the story was a heavy focus for the Direct. It focuses on your main character being an Officer’s Academy teacher to one of three houses; Golden Deer, Black Eagles, and Blue Lions. Definitely Hogwarts vibes which I heavily enjoy. </p>
     <p> They showcased an extraordinary new battle royale. Tetris 99. Tetris 99 is Free-to-Play where you go against 99 different people, each playing Tetris. It is available now. </p>
     <p> They brought a new Yoshi’s Crafted World trailer to the world and it is still coming out March 29th, but they showcased new power-ups, costumes, that gives you special abilities to traverse through levels; one is a Bullet Bill one, while another is a Nintendo Labo themed one which looks adorable in this style that they’ve implemented. They also announced a demo is available as you read this. So get it! </p>
     <p> Another demo that was announced was Daemon X Machina’s Prototype Missions demo. You will be able to play four different missions. The game is now pushed to Summer 2019 after being slated for the Spring. </p>
     <p> In the DLC department, they showcased new Captain Toad co-op content, announced 18 new challenges with five new courses. They also announced new Starlink Star Fox centric DLC where you now have missions tailored to being Peppy, Slippy, and Falco while facing the Star Wolf faction. That is being released starting in April. They strangely announced the next Smash Bros. update, but with no information about it, assuming for a full Smash Direct. </p>
     <p> In the surprise department, they announced a Link’s Awakening remake coming to the Switch for 2019, and it is looking adorable. It is in the same art style as A Link Between Worlds on the 3DS, but just more chibi-like. It is probably the most anticipated game for myself in this entire Direct. </p>
     <p> Another surprise was getting Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice on the Nintendo Switch for Spring of 2019. A game I missed out on, I am heavily looking forward to now. </p>
     <p> Two games that highly intrigued me were Oninaki and Astral Chain. Oninaki is by the studio who made I Am Setsuna and Lost Sphere. It is a isometric view, JRPG where you want to make alliances with souls to increase your power, while traveling to the world of the dead to conquer intense action battles. It looks very interesting for a game of that caliber. Astral Chain is by Platinum Games. It is an Action-RPG very similar to their previous games like, Metal Gear Rising, the Bayonetta series, and etc. We did not get much information about it, but the gameplay seems like it is co-op between you and your own robot who sometimes changes forms. We will find out if this is true and more information later. </p>
     <p> To cap things off, here is a list of games that were announced, or now have release dates are, Mortal Kombat 11 ( April Unravel Too (March 22nd), Assassin’s Creed 3 Remastered (May 21st), Final Fantasy 7 (March 26th), Final Fantasy 9 (Today!), Dragon Quest Builders 2 (July 12th), Dragon Quest XI S Definitive Edition (Fall 2019), Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night (Summer 2019), GRID Autosport (Summer 2019), Dead by Daylight (Fall 2019), Boxboy + Boxgirl (April 26th), Disney Tsum Tsum Festival (2019), Rune Factory 4 Special (2019), and Rune Factory 5 being in development. </p>
     <p> After this Direct, Nintendo’s 2019 looks incredible. They will be releasing The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening Remake, Astral Chain, Yoshi’s Crafted World, Pokemon Gen 8, Animal Crossing, Luigi’s Mansion, Super Mario Maker 2, Fire Emblem Three Houses, and some still rumored things which they might just wait to release until next year. This is on par to be a year like 2017 for Nintendo where they had a game for every month to talk about. </p>
     <p> With all of that grand information, till next time! </p>
