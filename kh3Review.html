   <p> Kingdom Hearts 3 is the true culmination that has been building for years. It ends off so well and closes off the Xehanort saga of Kingdom Hearts in a way that truly makes you wonder what they’ll do next. </p>

   <p> First things first, this game is gorgeous. The dedication that Square Enix has given this game truly shows when you go through each world, like Tangled, Hercules, Toy Story, Frozen, The Caribbean, etc. Worlds are now huge and not built into sections, but now just one cohesive area, with one or two loading screens in a world. Attraction Flow, where you control a famous Disney World ride, is so rambunctiously gorgeous and shows off the game excellently. </p>

   <p> Overall, the gameplay feels very fluid and very action-heavy. However, the game is also too easy, even on Proud Mode it can be easy for some. However, not that heavy of an issue. You are probably not playing this game for the difficulty. You can now switch between Keyblades during battle which is a tremendous move. Three different Keyblades for a situation adds a lot of strategy to the game now. You can equip an offensive Keyblade while you have one balanced Keyblade and another can be more magic focused, beautiful addition. </p>

   <p> The experiments in gameplay Square attempted with Dream Drop Distance (Flowmotion) and Birth By Sleep (Shotlock and special forms) are excellently executed here and are much more improved upon from their original incarnations. </p>

   <p> Some worlds that were mainstays in the series have been reduced to three small areas, or even no sections and just showing up in cutscenes. This is a bit of a let down, but the developers might not have had a substaintle idea for some worlds, or they might even add some as DLC if they do that. </p>

   <p> The main story seems easy to digest from a newcomer standpoint. You are Sora who is trying to get people for a final fight. The parts that involve Xehanort and the Real Organization XIII is where it gets a bit more confusing and more like a Kingdom Hearts story. However, when the game wants to make you cry, it will do that if you are a series veteran and it is gut wrenching. </p>

   <p> All the characters have their own controlled story arcs that are within the main story. These arcs are a lot better than some I remember from the series’ history, *cough* Mickey actually deals with hardship. *cough* </p>

   <p> Issues I had with the game were that some important characters from the series’ history are missing from this game, but they might have just wanted to focus on what was already the main story of this game. Another issue was the ease of the game as I’ve mentioned. Sometimes the game can be a bit overcrowded and you could lose your character in the fight. At times, there were some framerate issues that I noticed as well. </p>

   <p> Overall, Kingdom Hearts 3 is fun and engaging. The game is beautiful and truly showcases the dedication of Square Enix to make this game worth the 13-year wait. The gameplay is fluid. Gameplay experiments are heavily improved upon. It is too easy, but the story makes up for that I would say. The personality of worlds is really shown headstrong with worlds like Toy Story and Monsters Inc. Even if you have not played a Kingdom Hearts since 2, or even none, I would recommend this game heavily. </p>

   <h4> My Score: 9/10 </h4>
