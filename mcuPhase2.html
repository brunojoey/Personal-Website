     <p> The ranking of Phase 2 in the MCU is here! Phase 2 had some great introductions to characters we love now like the Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant-Man, and Vision. Phase 2 is when Marvel was beginning to get to the pedigree where we know them as now. Phase 2 still had some hiccups, but overall it is a great middle section of this legacy. </p>

     <p><b> 6) Thor: The Dark World </b></p>

     <p> Thor: The Dark World is somehow worse than the first Thor. It’s story is worse, it’s basically just a goose chase with some moments of okayness. I feel bad for Chris Hemsworth through the material he’s been given in his first two movies. Malekith could have so much potential for a villain since he’s a Thor mainstay villain, but they made him awful somehow. Tom Hiddleston does a great job for what he has. Natalie Portman’s character is used as a love interest who doesn’t have a real meaning again. The overall connectivity to the universe is rather fine. It introduces another Infinity Stone, but still. Not a fun movie whatsoever. </p>

     <p><b> 5) Iron Man 3 </b></p>

     <p> Iron Man 3 is a pretty okay movie in my mind. The idea of Tony Stark having PTSD from the events of Avengers is a pretty great idea to me, but they never brought this back up in future movies which is a let down. The new characters that were introduced are very okay. No real importance of them like the boy in Tennessee, or wherever Tony landed in. The overall story is pretty forgettable. Tony’s house is attacked, fights people that are terrorists. The Extremis aspect is largely a part of Iron Man lore that could have been better utilized. The Mandarin aspect. Pretty, pretty bad. A big Iron Man villain gets treated like an afterthought and gets a very uninteresting story arc. Overall, the ending is pretty okay as well. The scene of all Iron Man suits coming was a good looking scene, but it felt just for looks. </p>

     <p><b> 4) Avengers: Age of Ultron </b></p>

     <p> Age of Ultron is a pretty convoluted movie, but it has good moments for a mostly okay movie. It’s mainly okay because of the convolution that was brought into this movie. Ultron is shown as a truly menacing character, but he has a lot of potential that was untouched too. It is difficult to get the big awesome set-piece moments for a second time, but what they tried did work decent enough for what it's worth. The best part overall was the Hulkbuster armor being featured for the first time, and how they put that into the story was a good way to introduce it! Overall, this movie is okay, it definitely has problems like some character moments that don’t feel like their characters too much; like Thor at points and just skipping Tony’s Iron Man 3 arc. However, it is an okay follow-up to a movie that already was going to be tough to top. </p>

     <p><b> 3) Ant-Man </b></p>

     <p> We have reached the threshold between okay and good Marvel Phase 2 movies! This movie of course could’ve been possibly a lot better with Edgar Wright, but Peyton Reed definitely did a serviceable job to make this a pretty good way to end off Phase 2! Paul Rudd is the perfect person to play Scott Lang and the secondary characters definitely build a great world for Ant-Man to live in this already huge Marvel Universe. The stand out of course being Michael Peña’s Luis with his immense humor of recapping things swiftly. The villain and the story were both pretty average, but the cast balances that out. </p>

     <p><b> 2) Guardians of the Galaxy </b></p>

     <p> James Gunn expands the MCU into space and truly excels in every aspect, minus the curse of the first movie villain, which is forgivable at this point. The character dynamics are excellent. The cast shows great chemistry each line they speak. The environments are crazily detailed and looks so vivid and has so much atmosphere which is difficult to do for a new group that people have never heard of outside of the comic reader. The casting in this movie is pretty perfect as well. They all fit the character they’re portraying so well, but brings a new flair to them. This also brings us the first true appearance of Josh Brolin as Thanos which showcases how he would portray this character and does a great job. This movie truly is a pretty great first introduction to these characters. </p>

     <p><b> 1) Captain America: The Winter Soldier </b></p>

     <p> The Winter Soldier is the best Marvel movie up to this point. The entire story is so well rounded and brings up great moments in The First Soldier, but builds on them so greatly that you feel like they built on the goodness of The First Soldier and makes it a better movie. They play out this movie as a true sequel to the first movie and makes it so cohesive. The character dynamic between Cap and Black Widow is works so well. The villain is probably the best villain so far in the MCU at the point of release, the combination of Bucky and Alexander Pierce is such a great way to bring Hydra into the modern world. Both characters who had a history of Shield. Speaking of Hydra and Shield, the twists in this movie! Greatness personified. Okay, my gushing is over. </p>

     <p> Next time we are going over the best Phase out of all three so far, so be ready after Endgame! Thanks for taking the time to read this! Till next time! </p>
