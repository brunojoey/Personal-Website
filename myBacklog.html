     <p> My current backlog is the most significant undertaking I have ever taken in my life. The crazy thing is though, 99% percent of it, is Nintendo related. </p>

     <p> Ever since I have obtained a Nintendo Switch, my desire to get into more Nintendo franchises has grown. To do all of this, I have acquired many games I have missed over my life as a PlayStation-centric child. </p>

     <p> My goal for this current backlog is to finish one franchise before the release of Kingdom Hearts 3 on January 29th. Two franchises before that would be excellent, but that is if I’m feeling lucky as the weeks get closer. </p>

     <p> Currently, the first franchise I’m going through is the Metroid franchise. Well, the majority of it. The only ones I do not have access to play are the handheld ones currently; Metroid II, Metroid Fusion, Metroid: Zero Mission, and finally Metroid: Samus Returns, the remake of Metroid II. Those, I will not be playing, but will most likely look up a playthrough of them on good ole’ Youtube. I am going to be skipping Metroid: Other M just because of the reception I have heard of it. However, I would be gladly open to it if I hear otherwise. After finishing Metroid on the NES Classic and a few weeks ago, Super Metroid on the SNES Classic, I plan on going through the Metroid Prime trilogy to prepare myself for Metroid Prime 4! </p>

     <p> I owned Metroid Prime 2: Echoes as a child, but never got far into it due to other games I played, and most likely, my attention span. I’m also sure I was too young for that series still, but that is subjective! I enjoyed Metroid and Super Metroid quite a lot, so I am eager to see how Retro Studios brought the Metroid franchise into the 3D space, especially after hearing so much praise about it through the years. </p>

     <p> After these three games will be Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze; a game I never was able to play since the WiiU did not interest me all that much like most people. However, Spyro the Reignited Trilogy will be out as well, so we shall see if this game will be played. Once one of those games is finished though, it could be time for the game I have been waiting for my whole adult life, Kingdom Hearts 3. KH3 will be the culmination of half of my life. But, this post is not about games that will come out in the future. It is all about games that have come out before. </p>

     <p> After Kingdom Hearts 3, that is when the backlog plan gets obscured. I have games on the list like Ocarina of Time, Majora’s Mask, Wind Waker, and Twilight Princess to finish my year of catch-up on the Zelda series, but those games will need a break in-between. These games that could fill in that break are; Paper Mario: A Thousand Year Door, Final Fantasy XV, Pokemon Colosseum, Hollow Knight, The Messenger, and Guacamelee 1 and 2. However, all of these games are too far away for me to think about in a planned out way, which makes 2019 even more crazy with these games, and other games coming out like; Kingdom Hearts 3,  Anthem, Days Gone, Resident Evil 2 Remake, and all of the announced Nintendo games coming to the Switch next year. </p>

     <p> With that though, I will most likely be making another backlog post in a few months to give an update on this dreaded and undesirable journey I have ahead of me. </p>
