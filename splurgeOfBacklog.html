  <time> August 30, 2019 </time>
  <p> Here is another update on what I have been playing basically since April since I have been slacking on the blog in general for quite some time. </p>
  <p> Last splurge of games I’ve been playing, I mentioned I was debating on doing a Living Dex in various Pokemon games. Well, I can say after wrestling with this idea, I am through four generations of Pokemon. I conquered Let's Go in March, X, HeartGold, and Omega Ruby all in June and July! Minus a couple in each of the completed generations, I am almost 67% through having one of each Pokemon! Which is crazy to think about. </p>
  <p> I enjoyed Pokemon X more than I thought I would. The gaps in between the gyms were highly inconsistent, which had its down points, but overall it was an enjoyable adventure with all the Kalos Pokemon I never tried! </p>
  <p> I just need to beat four more games! In Generation 5, the issue is if I want to beat two games; White and White 2. Regardless, I will be completely through at least one game of each generation!. However, not sure if I will commit to a game before Sword & Shield. Too many games before then! </p>
  <p> Since April, I have gotten through 11 games somehow. Definitely won’t want to talk about all of em, but I finished Resident Evil 2 Remake which was truly amazing. RIght now my second favorite game of the year behind Kingdom Hearts 3. The Raccoon City Police building is one of the most hauntingly beautiful places I’ve experienced in a game. So I am trying to now get into the series by playing Resident Evil 0 and Resident Evil 1, which is in my queue! Where it has been for a few months. </p>
  <p> I also went into another new series for myself, Borderlands. I enjoyed what Borderlands was and I definitely want to play the second one to get ready for the third possibly. Enjoyed all the guns I got and the enemy designs were really well thought out in this world. However, the ending was pretty just rushed it seemed and not interesting to me. We shall see if that is addressed at all in the second one! </p>
  <p> Around June, Cadence of Hyrule came out. I was floored by how well this fitted into the Zelda world and integrated the rhythm gameplay that was in the Crypt of the Necrodancer so well. The music is incredible and you get into the rhythm for the songs as they go on so you can anticipate what to do. The areas are truly excellent and make this feel like one of the most unique Zelda experiences you will have. It has definitely been one of my favorites of the year so far. I hope Nintendo does more to let Indie developers use their IPs like this. </p>
  <p> Then came the binge session of the Pokemon series, but after that I beat the last 2D Metroid game I will be playing! Metroid Samus Returns was really a great remake of Metroid II. The world and art design works well with the 3D mechanics of the 3DS. However, I do want the pixelated art style of the previous 2D games again, so hopefully the next 2D game they go back to that style! Bring me Metroid 5! Even if Metroid Prime 4 is highly anticipated whenever that comes out! </p>
  <p> While I was beating Metroid Samus Returns, Fire Emblem: Three Houses came out. This would be my first foray into the Fire Emblem series ever so it was daunting. However, I fell in love with all of my Black Eagle students, sadly not Caspar because he died due to my ineptitude. Each character exerts their personality so well and is so well written. The growth of the characters throughout the 50 hour journey of my Black Eagle route, is enthralling and you feel like a proud teacher. The monastery is a setting that is both interesting with its many activities, but also an extension that breathes life into the areas. </p>
  <p> So far this year, I have beaten 19 games. 14 of those games have been in my backlog, whether it be newly added, or has been there for awhile. Bless the backlog being slowly conquered. </p>
  <p> The intention for the rest of the year is to get into all these new games coming out like Link’s Awakening, Control, Man of Medan with some friends, Pokemon Sword or Shield of course, and Death Stranding. Maybe I’ll be able to go through some games in my backlog too which would be quite nice to my heart. </p>
